#### Desktop vs thonkpad
The main differences between the Desktop and Laptop configs can be found in the quicksettings menu

![desktop-vs-thonkpad](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770789db-1b15-49b6-b3e4-ebebad961047)

If you're going for a laptop set-up, you can just replicate the thonkpad config
If you're going for a desktop set-up though, you are also most likely gonna want to switch the layout for the keybinds in `hyprland.conf` from colemak-dh to the default one

<summary> "Installing" </summary>

If you wish to replicate this set-up, you can follow the instructions written in the `giudalines.sh` file

Although it may be tempting to just run, it IS NOT an install script, and IT WILL most likely break your system in one way or another (if it even launches that is): ![uragirimono](giudalines.sh)

pro tip: a bunch of additional features and customization are hidden in `.config/ags/options.ts`

<summary> Known Issues && To-Do's </summary>

#### Known Issues
- Powerprofiles are inverted ('Performance' limits the CPU, while 'Power Saver' lets it go nuts)
- Quicksettings Random Wallpaper is executed multiple times on thonkpad for some hellish reason
- Selected Area Screenshot (`!full`) not sending notification unless a second is taken when using `grimblast` instead of `wayshot`
- Push-To-Talk AGS bar widget not updating unless by direct triggering
- AGS sometimes freezing: unknown cause or fix other than relaunching
- failed to find a way to set AGS qt env variable for dark/light theme switching (needed for software ran by the launcher)
- Hyprlock not launching on nvidia (after update) ---> compile from source
#### To-Do
- (personal): scripts to automate nzxt fan curve and rgb + lights off when 'suspended'
- (personal): vim config
- make apps ran via ags launcher not tied to ags
- fix known issues
