<summary> 'Installing' </summary>

If you wish to replicate this set-up, you can follow the instructions written in the `giudalines.sh` file

<summary> Known Issues && To-Do's </summary>

#### Known Issues
- Powerprofiles Inverted
- Random Wallpaper is executed multiple times on thonkpad for some hellish reason
- Selected Area Screenshot (`!full`) not sending notification unless a second is taken when using `grimblast` instead of `wayshot`
- Push-To-Talk AGS bar widget not updating unless by direct triggering
- AGS sometimes freezing: unknown cause or fix other than relaunching
- failed to find a way to set AGS qt env variable for dark/light theme switching (needed for software ran by the launcher)
- Hyprlock not launching on nvidia (after update) ---> compile from source
#### To-Do
- (personal) scripts to automate nzxt fan curve and rgb + lights off when 'suspended'
- (personal) vim config
- make apps ran via ags launcher not tied to ags
- fix known issues
